	Dear James Stone,\\
	
	Being given the chance to work as apart of the Console Group team would be an outstanding pleasure and experience. I enjoy being challenged and being able to learn from those challenges to become a more efficient and smarter programmer. I have experience with RESTful APIs through my work on my superthesis project, building a webapp (and a phoneapp) for a smarthome ecosystem. Through my superthesis project I have also gained experience using NoSQL databases (in particular RethinkDB), and through my experiences at Tyeware I also have experience using SQL. I have experience with Typescript, React, and SASS through my superthesis project.\\
	
	Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing a response,\\
	Daniel
